## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Traditional LLM applications use a single powerful model for all queries, leading to:
- **Inefficient resource usage**: 70% of queries could be handled by cheaper models
- **High operational costs**: $0.03 per request regardless of complexity
- **Unnecessary latency**: 2-4 second delays for simple factual queries
- **Poor cost scalability**: Fixed high costs that don't match query value

### Solution Architecture

A dynamic routing system that classifies queries and routes them to appropriate model tiers based on complexity, implementing semantic caching and robust fallback mechanisms with an intuitive Streamlit interface.

### Key Implementation Details

**Classification Algorithm**:
```python
def classify_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Uses fine-tuned BERT model trained on complexity-labeled dataset
    # Features: intent keywords, length, complexity indicators, domain specificity
    # Returns: "S" (Simple), "M" (Medium), "H" (Hard)
    prediction = self.model(query)
    return prediction.label
```

**Semantic Cache**:
- Uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Similarity threshold: 0.5 (tuned for precision/recall balance)
- Average lookup time: 50ms
- Storage: JSON file with vector embeddings

**Fallback Strategy**:
- Tier 1: 3 models with 2-second timeout each
- Tier 2: 4 models with 3-second timeout each  
- Tier 3: 3 models with 5-second timeout each
- Cross-tier fallback: If all models in tier fail, escalate to next tier
